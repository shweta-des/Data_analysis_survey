##  Project Overview

This project analyzes the 2022 Data Professional Survey (dataset by Alex the Analyst) to uncover insights about:
- Salary distribution across job titles
- Programming language preferences by role
- Career entry barriers
- Work-life balance and job satisfaction
- Geographic distribution of data professionals

##  Key Insights

### Entry Barriers
- **45%** of respondents report difficulty breaking into data roles
- Suggests high competition or skills-experience gap in the market

### Salary Analysis
- **Data Scientists** lead compensation at **$110K average**
- Entry-level roles (Students) average **$45K** (2.4x difference)
- Clear financial incentive for skill development

### Satisfaction Metrics
- **Salary Satisfaction:** 4.27/10 (concerning despite high pay)
- **Work-Life Balance:** 5.74/10 (moderate satisfaction)
- Indicates retention challenges beyond compensation

### Technical Skills
- **Python dominates** at 61% across all roles
- Essential skill for career advancement in data field
- R, SQL, and other languages represent smaller segments

### Geographic Distribution
- **41%** of respondents from United States
- Significant presence in India and Canada
- Growing global distribution of data talent

##  Tools & Technologies

- **Power BI Desktop** - Data visualization and dashboard creation
- **DAX** - Calculated measures and data modeling
- **Power Query** - Data cleaning and transformation

##  Dashboard Features

### Interactive Elements
- **Gender Filter** - Compare metrics across gender demographics
- **Country Filter** - Analyze data by geographic region
- **Job Title Filter** - Drill down into specific roles

### Visualizations
1. **Bar Chart** - Average salary by job title (sorted by value)
2. **Donut Charts** - Entry difficulty breakdown, satisfaction gauges
3. **Stacked Bar** - Programming language preferences by role
4. **Treemap** - Geographic distribution of survey respondents
5. **KPI Cards** - Average age and total respondent count

## 🔄 Project Evolution

### Version 1 (Before)
- Static visualizations
- Unsorted data (alphabetical)
- Cluttered layout
- Limited interactivity

### Version 2 (After)
- Interactive slicers for dynamic filtering
- Value-sorted charts for better readability
- Cleaned layout with improved spacing
- Strategic visual selection (removed low-value charts)
- Clear data labels on all visualizations

##  Lessons Learned

1. **Interactivity Matters** - Slicers transformed static charts into exploration tools
2. **Sorting is Critical** - Value-based sorting dramatically improves readability
3. **Less is More** - Removed visuals that didn't add meaningful insights
4. **Data Labels Save Time** - Users shouldn't have to guess values
